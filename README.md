# Food-delivery-Cost-and-Profit-Analysis
Food Delivery Cost and Profitability Analysis is a comprehensive evaluation aimed at understanding and optimizing the financial dynamics of a food delivery operation. The goal is to identify areas where the service can reduce costs, increase revenue, and implement pricing or commission strategies that enhance profitability.

This Project involves examining all the costs associated with delivering food orders, from direct expenses like delivery fees and packaging to indirect expenses like discounts offered to customers and commission fees paid by restaurants. By juxtaposing these costs against the revenue generated (primarily through order values and commission fees), the analysis aims to provide insights into how profitable the food delivery service is on a per-order basis.

Below is the process I followed to do this project:

I started by gathering comprehensive data related to all aspects of food delivery operations.

Cleaned the dataset for inconsistencies, missing values, or irrelevant information.

Extracted relevant features that could impact cost and profitability.

Next, I have break down the costs associated with each order, including fixed costs (like packaging) and variable costs (like delivery fees and discounts).

Determine the revenue generated from each order, focusing on commission fees and the order value before discounts.

For each order, calculated the profit by subtracting the total costs from the revenue. Analyze the distribution of profitability across all orders to identify trends.

Based on the cost and profitability analysis,I developed strategic recommendations aimed at enhancing profitability.

Finally I used the data to simulate the financial impact of proposed changes, such as adjusting discount or commission rates.
